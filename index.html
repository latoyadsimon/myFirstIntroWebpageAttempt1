     <h2 class="text-centered">Hi! I'm LaToya Simon</h2>
       <p>I am a software developer from Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
       <p>I am still finding my way in life but I know that what I'm meant to do involves bringing people closer together.</p>
       <p>I'm a lifelong student and as such, I'm interested in:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Putting my thoughts into actions just as a computer would do with code.</li>
         <li>Exploring to find workable solutions to problems, it's all about the journey, I know we'll get there eventually!</li>
         <li>Working with a group that helps each other to grow and succeed, while also having the occasional inside joke.</li>
       </ul>
       <p class="text-centered">~We could all use a good laugh every now and again right?~</p>

     <h2 class="text-centered">~About LaToya~</h2>
     
     <p>Growing up in Vegas, it's always been said that I have a knack for entertaining people. Though my humor is in the moment, and I'm a bit of an omnivert, that just means the fun is waiting to begin! I just have to warm up first. I am a creative person with many artistic hobbies that you can find out more about once you strike up the conversation. So don't be shy, I'm an open book.</p>
     <p>I have a Bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice from the University of Nevada Las Vegas. 
I am a survivor with epic tales of woah and success. I like to write in my free time, that's a little hint. As I brought my own characters to life, I began to realize that I wanted more out of mine. After much research and exploration, I found myself a student at Thinkful and I can't wait to see what happens next! No spoilers, but there is a pretty good chance that I'm standing on the edge of great. </p>
     <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer, I volunteer as tribute! I'm a diamond in the rough who is excited to work with great people and build great software. If you however are not looking for a new developer, I suggest you reach out anyway. You never want to pass up this kind of opportunity. Plus, I'm always willing to answer a curious question or two. It never hurts to ask.</p>
